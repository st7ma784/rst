# SUPERDARN Test Data

This directory contains synthetic rawacf test data for CI/CD testing.

## Files:
- `test_small.rawacf` - Small dataset (25 ranges, 10 lags) for quick validation
- `test_medium.rawacf` - Medium dataset (75 ranges, 18 lags) for standard tests  
- `test_large.rawacf` - Large dataset (150 ranges, 25 lags) for performance tests

## Data Characteristics:
- Realistic exponential decay with range and lag
- Gaussian noise added for realism
- Compatible with SUPERDARN processing algorithms
- Deterministic generation for reproducible tests

## Usage:
These files are automatically used by the CI/CD pipeline for:
- CUDA vs CPU correctness validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory leak testing
- Integration testing
